            <img src="../images/July 6, 2022 (24).jpg" alt="Picture of Anupa Ragoonanan at Niagara Falls.">
            <p>Anupa is a skilled Digital Communicator with a diploma in Media Communications (2022) and a degree in Digital Communications (2024) from Humber College, now pursuing a diploma in Computer Programming at the institute.</p>
            <h3><strong>Media Communications</strong></h3>
            <p>During Anupa's time in the Media Communications program, she developed her skills in photography, cinematography, web design (UI/UX), graphic and motion design, strategic writing, marketing and advertising and content creation.
                Although the majority of her time was spent learning online due to COVID, she developed a stronger connection with her love for photography and UI/UX.
                It has prompted her to delve into her admiration for wildlife photography. She has since developed a strong interest in photography, UI/UX, graphic design, and writing due to its boundless creativity.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Digital Communications</strong></h3>
            <p>Anupa never planned to pursue a degree, but with the encouragement of her program coordinator, Cathy Bidini, from Media Communications, she applied for September 2022 enrollment into the Digital Communications program at Humber.
                The transition from online schooling to in-person schooling, and the transfer from practical learning to theoretical learning, was a drastic and difficult change for Anupa.
                Luckily, within the first month of beginning the program, she made strong friendships with other transfer students like herâ€”sadly, none of them were from her Media Communications program.
                However, she invested as much as she could into achieving her degree, graduating with profound knowledge in social media, marketing & advertising, and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>What Anupa enjoyed most about her time pursuing her Digital Communications is the midday walks along the lake, the encouragement from her program coordinator, Jessica Thom, and the study sessions with her friends.</p>
            <p>During the final months of the program, she was not sure what her plan was... Pursue a master's? Further her skills in another area of interest? Work? Freelance? In the end, she got a combination!</p>
            <h3><strong>April - September 2024</strong></h3>
            <p>After 15+ job rejections and having no alternative plan in mind for after completing her degree, Anupa applied to enroll in the Computer Programming program at Humber to further her web skills and languages.
                She was quickly accepted to the program and chose to study online for its flexibility. This worked out in her favor, as in July, she recieved the opportunity to assist and manage a not-for-profit organization's social media.
                Initially worried about how she would manage full-time schooling and freelance working, she has been astonished at how she has juggled schooling, working, and being there for her family after spending 4 years jumping between Brampton, Etobicoke, Toronto, and Ajax.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Computer Programming</strong></h3>
            <p>So far during Anupa's first semester of Computer Programming, she has developed an introductory knowledge in computer algorithms, databases, JavaScript and operating systems while refreshing her HTML and CSS skills.</p>
